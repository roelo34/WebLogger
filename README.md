# WebLogger
Weblogger is a Chrome extension that helps with internet investigations.
This extension is specifically made for internet investigations conducted by the FICT specialization at Hogeschool Leiden.
This also explains why the default log headers are all in Dutch.

## Disclaimer
I am relatively new at creating Chrome extensions and JavaScript. That is why the code is very messy and probably poorly optimized.
If you have any suggestions, you can send me a message or fork the repo.
